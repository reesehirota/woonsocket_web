    "text": "Physical activity is an excellent way for people of all ages to take charge of their health. Regular physical activity results in numerous health benefits - such as decreased risk for chronic disease and early death. Cities that are built to support physical activity not only improve residents’ health, but also enrich the community by promoting economic stimulation and social connection.\nIn order to create an environment conducive to physical activity, per the Community Preventive Services Task Force’s built environment recommendation, the CDC recommends city-planners focus on everyday destinations and activity-friendly routes. Everyday destinations can be improved by increasing their proximity to other community & neighborhood destinations, leveraging land use mechanisms, and assessing the appropriate level of residential density. As for activity-friendly routes, some measures of quality include: street pattern design & connectivity, pedestrian & bicycle infrastructure, and public transit infrastructure & access. In practice, this all might look like sidewalks, trails, and/or parks that are safe and convenient for residents to integrate into their daily routines.\nTogether, the City of Woonsocket and advocates, have taken measures to improve the built environment by:\n\nMaintaining flexibility in City zoning and land use policies to meet current needs as appropriate\nProviding regional bicycle connections and recreational opportunities for both residents and visitors, through paths like the Blackstone River Bikeway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline Highlights\n\n\n\n\nBlackstone River Bikeway\n2007-2018\nTotals to over 18 miles of bikeway.\n\n\nMixed-Use Overlay Zoning\n2015 - expanded 2024\nResulted in 600 new housing units and the decline of store-front vacancies from 50% to &lt;18%, all contributing to a more vibrant, walkable downtown.\n\n\nTruman Drive Greenway project\n2023-2024\nIncorporating the Blackstone River Bikeway - provides recreational, economic, and public health benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  subgraph Land Use\n    B[\"`&lt;b&gt;Downtown Redevelopment Area Designation&lt;/b&gt;\n    2014`\"] --&gt; C[\"`&lt;b&gt;Mixed-Use Overlay Zoning - Downtown Main Street District&lt;/b&gt;\n    2015 (expanded 2024)`\"]\n    C[\"`&lt;b&gt;Mixed-Use Overlay Zoning - Downtown Main Street District&lt;/b&gt;\n    2015 (expanded 2024)`\"] --&gt; Z[\"`&lt;b&gt;Proposed zoning text & map revisions&lt;/b&gt;\n    2024`\"]\n  end \n  \n  subgraph Pedestrian & Cyclist Networks\n    F(\"`&lt;b&gt;Blackstone River Bikeway&lt;/b&gt;\n    2007-2018`\") --&gt; A[\"`&lt;b&gt;Bikeway Signage&lt;/b&gt;\n    2014`\"]\n    A[\"`&lt;b&gt;Bikeway Signage&lt;/b&gt;\n    2014`\"] --&gt; G(\"`&lt;b&gt;Truman Drive Greenway project in the City of Woonsocket&lt;/b&gt;\n    2023-2024`\")\n    G(\"`&lt;b&gt;Truman Drive Greenway project in the City of Woonsocket&lt;/b&gt;\n    2023-2024`\") --&gt; D[\"`&lt;b&gt;Safe Streets for All&lt;/b&gt;\n    2024`\"]\n    G(\"`&lt;b&gt;Truman Drive Greenway project in the City of Woonsocket&lt;/b&gt;\n    2023-2024`\") --&gt; E[\"`&lt;b&gt;Ban of electronic bikes in City parks&lt;/b&gt;\n    2024`\"]\n  end\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPedestrian & Cyclist Networks\n\nBlackstone River Bikeway (2007-2018): a part of the Blackstone River Greenway, a 48-mile trail from Worcester, MA, to Providence, RI, has significant portions completed, but several gaps remain.
